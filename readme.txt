The program only requires that python (2.x.x) is installed.
No other installation is required, as the code only uses
the python standard libraries.

The code was tested using Python 2.7.10 and macOS
(The code can also be found at https://github.com/ameykusurkar/webcrawler)

To run the web crawler, call the crawler.py script on 
the command line in the following format:

$ python crawler.py <url>

So for example, to run the web crawler on gocardless.com,
run the following command:

$ python crawler.py gocardless.com
